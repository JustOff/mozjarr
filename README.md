### [<sub>â¬‡</sub> MozJAR Recompressor](https://github.com/JustOff/mozjarr/releases)

**MozJAR Recompressor** is a simple script that allows you to recompress Jar archives (`omni.ja` / `palemoon.res`) used in _Mozilla_ based browsers, such as _Firefox_, _Pale Moon_, _SeaMonkey_ or _Waterfox_. It can be used to change the compression algorithm (`Deflate` / `Brotli`), optimization and preload settings.
